#Evolve

A demo project, started with investigating React

- Got routing to work
- Got some basic components
- Introduced Material UI stuff

##To do
* Get login button to work
* Get rid of old bootstrap code for editing carrots (even though rendered obsolete by the drop in grid, it may be worth keeping)
